# Matrix-rx

---

A Matrix Chat client library based on RxJS. 

The reason d'etre of this library is to provide a developer friendly, extensible interface for building on Matrix protocol.

This is currently very much dev focused and not trying to be a full-fledged Matrix client.  
That said you can try the current version at https://sparkly-semolina-f47de2.netlify.app
